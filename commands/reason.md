# /reason — Complex Reasoning & Debugging

Tackle complex algorithmic challenges and deep debugging.

## Usage
```
/reason optimize this sorting algorithm
/reason debug this race condition
/reason design a cache eviction strategy
```

## Behavior

1. Define the problem formally (inputs, outputs, constraints)
2. Analyze current complexity (time/space)
3. Consider edge cases and failure modes
4. Design solution with correctness proof
5. Optimize after correctness is established

## Invokes
- Agent: reasoner (Codex via codex-shell MCP)
