# Planning Skill

This skill organizes complex objectives into manageable sub-tasks.

## Instructions
1.  **Decompose**: Break the main objective into 3-5 high-level phases.
2.  **Detail**: For the immediate next phase, break it down into actionable steps.
3.  **Assign**: Determine which "Agent Persona" (Frontend, Backend, Tester) is best suited for each step.
4.  **Execute**: Execute the steps sequentially, updating the plan as you go.

## Usage
Use this skill when a user request is too large to be solved in a single turn.
Create a `PLAN.md` file to track progress if the task spans multiple sessions.
