# Planning — Task Decomposition

This skill is an alias for the **plan** skill. Use `/plan` for full implementation planning.

## Redirect
When this skill is invoked, execute the **plan** skill protocol instead.
See: `skills/plan/SKILL.md` for the complete planning protocol.

## Quick Summary
1. Analyze requirements and clarify scope
2. Explore codebase for existing patterns
3. Break down into ordered, atomic tasks with dependencies
4. Assess risks (technical, integration, performance)
5. Document plan with task table, risk register, and testing strategy

## Boundaries

**Will**: Plan, decompose, analyze, assess risks
**Will Not**: Implement code — PLANNING ONLY
